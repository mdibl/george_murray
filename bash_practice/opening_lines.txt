Call me Ishmael.
The primroses were over.
Now is the winter of our discontent.
All children, except one, grow up.
The Galactice Empire was dying.
In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit.
It was a pleasure to burn.
It was a birght, cold day in Aprile, and the clocks were striking thirteen.
It was love at first sight.
I am an invisible man. 
It was the day my grandmother exploded. 
When he was nearly thirteen, my brother Jem go his arm badly broken at the elbow. 
Marley was dead, to begin with.
